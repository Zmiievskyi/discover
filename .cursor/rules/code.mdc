Always follow software engineering best practices:
- Keep files under 200 lines (split into modules if larger)
  File length best practices:
    - Target: 100-200 lines per file
    - Maximum: 300 lines (split if larger)
    - Minimum: 50 lines (merge if smaller)
    - Exceptions:
      * Config files can be longer
      * Test files can reach 400 lines
      * Simple interfaces/types can be < 50 lines
    - When approaching 250 lines, consider refactoring
    - Split by functionality, not arbitrary line count
- Single Responsibility Principle: one class/function = one purpose
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): extract repeated code into functions
- SOLID principles for object-oriented code
- Clear, descriptive naming (variables, functions, classes)
- Proper error handling and validation
- Write testable, modular code

For all Python projects:
- Always create virtual environment first: `python -m venv venv`
- Activate before any Python operations:
  * macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
- Install all dependencies in venv: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Create requirements.txt for all projects
- Never use global pip install
- Include venv/ in .gitignore
- Start every Python session with: "First, activate your virtual environment"
- If user forgets venv, remind: "Don't forget to activate venv first!"
