Always keep tracking for image version and describe what version what changes.
Before major code changes:
- Suggest: "Commit your current work before proceeding"
- Explain what changes will be made
- Recommend descriptive commit message
- For refactoring: create separate commit for "Before refactoring"
- Use semantic commit messages (feat:, fix:, refactor:, docs:)
